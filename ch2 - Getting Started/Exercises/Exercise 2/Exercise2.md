# Exercise 2 

Describe a ```nlog(n)``` time algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another integer x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.  
### EX-1:
Giving ```array = [2,3,4,8,20,13,17]``` and ``` x = 15 ```
Answer should be: ```2,13``` as ```2 + 13 = 15```
### EX-2:
Giving ```array = [2,3,4,8,20,13,17]``` and ``` x = 30 ```
Answer should be: ```Not Exist``` as we don't have any two numbers which there sum equal to 30
### EX-3:
Giving ```array = [0,2,3,4,8,20,13,17]``` and ``` x = 20 ```
Answer should be: ```0,20``` or ```3,17``` as ```0 + 20 = 20 & 3 + 17 = 20 ```
